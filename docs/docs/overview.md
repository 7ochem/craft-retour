# Retour Overview

Retour allows you to intelligently redirect legacy URLs, so that you don’t lose SEO value when rebuilding & restructuring a site.

In addition to supporting traditional exact and regular expression matching of URL patterns, Retour allows you to have dynamic redirects that have access to the data in your entries when matching URL patterns.

Retour offers true multi-site capability, allowing you to have redirects that affect only certain sites, as well as all sites. Retour will also automatically create a redirect for you if you change an entry’s slug, or move an entry around in a Structure.

Retour also has a Short Link field that allows your content authors to easily create short links or aliases to entries.

Retour even supports GraphQL so it can work with a SPA frontend, while allowing your content editors the ability to monitor & maintain 404s via the Craft CP.

Unlike other redirect plugins or utilizing `.htaccess` to do redirects, Retour does not add overhead to each request for each redirect you have in place.

Retour is written to be performant. There is no impact on your website’s performance until a 404 exception happens; and even then the resulting matching happens with minimal impact.

Don’t just rebuild a site. Transition it with Retour.
